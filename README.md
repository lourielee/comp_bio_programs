# comp_bio_programs

hypergeometric.cpp:
This program demonstrates the use of c++ instead of Perl or python for working with large amounts of data. This project shows how to parse input data (text files) into maps, intersect datasets, and ultimately calculate the probabilities of the results (hypermetric distribution in this case). The purpose is to utilize the efficiency of using a compiled language, which makes a noticable difference when running very big jobs.

make_geo_table.pl
The purpose of this Perl program is to make a data table. It demonstates how to parse an input file containing a list of url's, get those html pages, and extract specific data from each html page.
